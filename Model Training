Below the models I'm going to test on cross validation:
Baseline
DummyClassifier
Linear
SGDClassifier
SVC
Tree based
ExtraTreesClassifier
LGBMClassifier
Neural Network
MLPClassifier
We will tune the hyperparameters on the one with the highest score. Finally we'll train it on the full X_train/y_train and test it on the X_test/y_test. If necessary we will regularize it.
